# Packaging Machine Controller Board Design

This repository contains the design of a controller board for a packaging machine based on the Teensy 3.5 microcontroller. The controller board allows for control of the motors, sensors, and actuators necessary for the packaging process.

## Installation

To use this controller board, the KiCAD circuit design software is required. Clone this repository and open the .pro file in KiCAD.

## Usage

The controller board is designed to be used in a packaging machine. The pins are labeled and can be easily connected to the corresponding motors, sensors, and actuators.

The firmware necessary for the operation of the packaging machine can be loaded onto the Teensy 3.5 microcontroller using the Arduino development software.
